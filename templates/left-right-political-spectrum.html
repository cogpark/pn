#  "Left" and "right" in U.S. politics

## Overview
"Left" and "right," or left-wing and right-wing, are opposing political perspectives. We often talk about left-wing and right-wing ideas as falling along a spectrum, with right-wing ideas being more [conservative](/whats-a-conservative) and leftist ideas being more progressive or [liberal](/whats-a-liberal). This means that left-wing ideas and policies usually aim to reduce inequality and redistribute resources more evenly among members of a society. Right-wing ideas are usually aimed at preserving the current social order, or returning it to a social order of the past.  

Left-leaning people tend to vote for [Democrats]('/whats-a-democrat'), and right-wingers for [Republicans]('/whats-a-republican'), though more extreme leftists and rightists believe that these parties don't go far enough in their policy goals. 

That said, political beliefs and political coalitions can get messy, and the generalizations I just made leave out quite a lot. People don't place themselves on political spectrums, and they may be in favor of leftist policies for some issues and rightist for others. (People are complicated, which is probably one reason politics is.)

## The "left" of the political spectrum

The term "leftist" isn't just a metaphor. It comes from the French Revolution. When the French Estates General (a legislative body, like Congress) gathered, the group seated on the left side favored a revolution that brought down the monarchy. 

This anti-royalty stance is still visible in most of the political groups that occupy the left side of the political spectrum. At the farthest left are people who favor anarchy or socialism, belief systems where power is widely distributed, and no one person or government is in charge. 

Leftists want to reduce inequality and increase access to basic needs, such as food, shelter, and healthcare, though they disagree about how to achieve these goals. People who are farther left argue that government should solve problems--make housing more affordable, increase wages, reduce unemployment, etc--and center-left people advocate a combination of government and private industry solutions. 

It may sound confusing that some people on the far left are skeptical of letting a government have a lot of power while others think it should solve all social issues--but that's how it is. One (partial) explanation for this is that many leftists are skeptical of private industry and see government solutions as more likely to benefit constituents than shareholders. For example, one commonly discussed left-wing policy idea is that the government should replace private insurance companies in paying for medical care.

People who hold this sort of view might prefer [Democratic Socialist]('/democratic-socialist') or extremely [liberal candidates](/'whats-a-liberal'). This doesn't necessarily mean they always vote for the most liberal candidate on the ballot; sometimes it's more practical to vote for a less-liberal but more popular candidate.

At the center-est center left of the political spectrum are people we might call "incrementalists." They may agree with the rest of the left about what problems need to be solved, but they prefer less radical solutions, or at least solutions that are less likely to disrupt everyday life. An incrementalist policy is one that tweaks laws or institutions rather than re-writing or re-building them entirely. For example, in combatting climate change, an incrementalist policy might call for something like an additional tax on companies who produce a lot of carbon, encouraging them to change their behavior. Conversely, a more hard-core leftist might want a policy that disallows the use of fossil fuels, or puts a hard cap on how much a company can use. 

## The "right" of the political spectrum

"Right-wing," like "left-wing," comes from the French Estates General, where lawmakers who sat on the right were in favor of preserving the monarchy. Today's U.S. "rightists" all want preserve something, though they don't always agree on what that something is. Also, most of them don't want to return to living under a king. (By the way, "rightists" is not a word you'll often hear, probably because it's awkward to say.)

Religious conservatives want to prevent our values and traditions from changing in ways that run counter to what's written in the Bible, or at least to how Christians have traditionally lived. (You can be a Muslim or Jewish conservative, but Christians make up the broadest group of U.S. religious conservatives). Religious conservatives want to make abortion and gay marriage illegal, and to make prayer in schools mandatory. 

Economic conservatives want to prevent the government from spending more money, or starting new programs or agencies. They favor lower taxes and less business regulation, and they often argue that the government should do nothing more than what the Constitution lays out. It's useful to remember that the Constitution was a reaction to government by an all-powerful monarch, and for conservatives, one of its best features is reducing the scope and power that government has. A central tension in U.S. politics today is that economic conservatives believe private corporations are better able to solve problems than government, and economic liberals believe the exact opposite.

You might notice that religious and economic conservatism imply policies that run counter to one another. Religious conservatives often want government to play a larger role in American life by restricting or enforcing behaviors. Since wanting the government to do anything usually means expanding it and spending more money, you might think that economic and religious conservatives would be opposed to one another. While there is often tension between these two groups, it's also true that by voting together they increase their collective political power. They usually vote for [Republicans]('/whats-a-republican'), though people who want to dramatically reduce the size of govenment might vote for a [Liberatarian]('/whats-a-libertarian'). 
Interestingly, hardcore libertarians share with hardcore left-wingers a mistrust of people and organziations with too much power.

One final right-wing stance is _cultural conservatism_. At its most extreme, this perspective takes a Fascist stance and draws from political movements like Naziism. Cultural conservatives want to prevent culture from evolving. They tend to be anti-immigrantm and nationalistic. They often believe that Western European and American culture is intrinsically superior to others. 

## People are complicated and don't often fit neatly on the political spectrum

Placing most individuals on a political spectrum is nearly impossible, as their positions and philosophies tend to change from issue to issue. For example, it's possible to believe both that the government should spend less money, but also that it should pay for healthcare. 

This might not be true, however, for people who are quite politically engaged. In the U.S., this is in part because our political parties play an outsized role. As people begin to identify with one party or another, they also begin to adopt that party's beliefs. This may be because they are exposed to more information and form an opinion that they otherwise wouldn't have, or it may be because politics has become a team sport, and as when you see yourself as part of a team, you want your team to win on all issues. 

Regardless, it's best to see the left-right spectrum as a tool for understanding the ideas and stances that shape our politics.
